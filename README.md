## Monet: The Water Lily Pond
This project provides a simple yet effective way to identify and display the dominant colors present in an image, using "thewaterlilypond.jpg" as an example.

**Why?** Understanding the primary colors in an image can be useful for various applications, such as design inspiration, analysis, or even recreating a specific aesthetic.

**How?** The core functionality relies on the colorgram.py library to intelligently extract the most representative colors. These colors are then visualized as a distinct color palette using `matplotlib`.
